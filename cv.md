### About Myself:

I got acquainted with the Front-end in 2018 on the site freecodecamp.org. Since then I started to get involved in the front-end.

In 2019, I signed up for the Front End Developer courses at the IT Academy Bishkek.

At the end of 2019, I graduated from these courses and gained a lot of knowledge. I am still looking for a new job and at the same time I do not stop at development.

My biggest dream is get into EPAM Systems.
